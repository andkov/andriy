November 2020. (Link)\nIntroduction\rWhen reporting disease rates to the public, a health system must take precaution to protect released data from re-identification risks. While specific guidelines and methods vary across data systems and governances1, redaction of cells with small values is a key component in any approach for preparing data for public release. These preparations, when conducted manually, have proven to be arduous, time consuming, and prone to human error. Although finding a “small” value (e.g. “\u0026lt; 5” ) is straightforward, detecting conditions in which suppressed values could be recalculated from related cells involves human judgment.\n\rObjectives and Approach\rGuided by the real-world objective to reports the rates of chronic diseases in British Columbia, we aimed to design a reproducible workflow that would augment human decision-making and offer a nimble quality control tool, approachable by epidemiologists without technical background. Our workflow (1) splits data into disease-by-year data frames of a specific form, (2) applies a sequence of algorithms trained to recognize conditions that made recalculation of suppressed values possible and (3) prints a graph for each case of suggested automatic redaction to be confirmed by a human.\n\rResults\rThe augmented suppression system was successfully integrated into the maintenance of Chronic Disease Dashboard, an online reporting tool of the Observatory for Population and Public Health designed to address the gap in surveillance of chronic diseases in British Columbia. Anticipating the evolution of suppression logic, we isolated the logical tests responsible for redaction and provided several options to vary the degree of preserved information.\n\rConclusion \u0026amp; Implications\rInstead of employing a complex generalizable solution, we make a case for organizing the procedure for small cell redaction as a data visualization task, allowing for straightforward quality control of suppression decision and thus more approachable to a non-technical audience, as well as for employing such learning devices as workflow maps and function dependency trees for structuring applied projects and ensuring their reproducibility.\n\r","date":1604966400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604966400,"objectID":"3bd8d4af04cecb8de33b444c12e709ce","permalink":"/publication/koval-2020-suppress-for-release/","publishdate":"2020-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koval-2020-suppress-for-release/","section":"publication","summary":"Demonstrates using reproducible data visualisations for augmenting redaction decisions during small cell supression and creating documentaion transparent for non-technical audit.","tags":["small cell suppression","chronic disease surveillance","public health","reproducible research","ggplot2"],"title":"Using Reproducible Data Visualisations to Augment Decision-Making During Suppression of Small Counts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andriy Koval","Kyle Belanger"],"categories":["analytic workflow","graph making","reproducible research"],"content":"\r\r\rAbstract\rData\rQ1 - Overall Trend\rQ2 - Suicide across lifespan\rQ3 - Prevalent Methods\rQ4 - Methods across Years\rQ5 - Sex and Ethnicity\rsession information\r\r\rThis blogpost graphs the trends of youth suicides in Florida from 2006 to 2017, exploring the differences in age, sex, and race among persons 10 years and older.\nAbstract\rThis blogpost explores suicide trends among youth (ages 10 - 24) in Florida between 2006 and 2017, examining the effects of race and gender. The post answers the following questions with respect to population in focus:\n\rQ1 - What is the overall trajectory of youth suicides in FL between 2006 and 2017?\n\r\rQ2 - What ages are most vulnerable to suicide?\n\r\rQ3 - What are the most prevalent methods of youth suicide?\n\r\rQ4 - How do trends compare across the methods of suicide?\n\r\rQ5 - How do trends compare by race, sex, and methods of suicide?\n\r\rData\rThe suicide data comes from Florida Health Charts and contains suicide mortality between 2006 and 2017, broken down by suicide means, county, sex, age, and race. Additionally, we use Bridged-Race Population Estimates to help with age-specific rate calculations.\nThe groomed data sets are available for download: FL Suicides and FL Population Estimates.\nThe observation unit is defined by the first 6 variables: county, year, sex, race, ethnicity, age_group. For each unit, there are two measures: the number of people (n_population) and the number of observed suicide events (n_suicides). The latter is broken down by means of suicide.\nRows: 19,296\rColumns: 16\r$ county \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachu...\r$ year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 200...\r$ sex \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Femal...\r$ age_group \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 10-14,...\r$ race \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Black \u0026amp; Other, Black \u0026amp; Other, Black \u0026amp; Other, Black \u0026amp; Other, Black \u0026amp; O...\r$ ethnicity \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Hispanic, Hispanic, Hispanic, Non-Hispanic, Non-Hispanic, Non-Hispani...\r$ n_population \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 50, 125, 250, 2410, 3763, 4695, 390, 1038, 2060, 3215, 6993, 14660, 5...\r$ n_suicides \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Drugs \u0026amp; Biological Substances` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Other Gases \u0026amp; Vapors` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Hanging, Strangulation, Suffocation` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Firearms Discharge` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Jump From High Place` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Other \u0026amp; Unspec \u0026amp; Sequelae` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ `Other \u0026amp; Unspec Sol/Liq \u0026amp; Vapor` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\r$ race_ethnicity \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Black \u0026amp; Other + Hispanic, Black \u0026amp; Other + Hispanic, Black \u0026amp; Other + H...\rRows: 875,824\rColumns: 11\r$ county \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Alachua, Al...\r$ year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 20...\r$ sex \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Female, Fema...\r$ age \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7,...\r$ race \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Black \u0026amp; Other, Black \u0026amp; Other, White, White, Black \u0026amp; Other, Black \u0026amp; Other, White, White, Blac...\r$ ethnicity \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Hispanic, Non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Non-Hispan...\r$ n_population \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 9, 413, 61, 672, 6, 368, 66, 602, 11, 401, 57, 655, 9, 364, 76, 629, 8, 363, 51, 633, 3, 383...\r$ n_suicides \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,...\r$ n_firearms \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,...\r$ n_other \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,...\r$ race_ethnicity \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Black \u0026amp; Other + Hispanic, Black \u0026amp; Other + Non-Hispanic, White + Hispanic, White + Non-Hispan...\rAnother data set, ds2, augmented with CDC population estimates, has very similar structure, but differs from ds1 in three respects:\nInstead of age_group it features age, measured in whole years, providing higher resolution\n\rMortality cause is grouped into two categories fireamrs and other, as opposed to a more granular, 7-category classification of mortality cause in ds1\n\rCovers years 2000-2018 as opposed to 2006-2018 in ds1\n\r\rSummary of differences in data sets used in the report:\r\r\rdata set\rsuicide means\rage resolution\ryears covered\r\r\r\rds1\r7\rage group\r2006 - 2017\r\rds2\r2\r1 year\r2000 - 2018\r\r\r\rThese differences arose from certain limitations in data procurement.

The numerical value of this metric answer the question “One in how many individuals commit suicide?”\nThe number of youth suicides increased by 98 cases, rising from 203 in 2006 to 301 in 2017, constituting a 33% growth. If in 2006 one out every 17.5 thousands committed suicide, in 2017 one out of every 12 thousand individuals between age 10 and 24 took their own life. The demographic growth does not explain the increased number of suicide cases: the rate per 100,000 increased by 45% from 5.74 to 8.34.\nGiven these general trends for the entire 10 - 24 group, we would like to understand how trends in population growth, suicide count and suicide rate compare among age group:\nThe 10-14 age group exhibits quite a dramatic decrease in the One out of measure, dwarfing the scale for the other two age groups. We recreate it separately:\nDemographic changes deserved to be examined seperately:\nNote the sharp change in population count from 2011 to 2013. The 15-19 group dropped, while the 20-24 group grew quite dramatically. A closer examination, shows that while this demographic growth was present in all racial groups, it was particularly pronounced among Non-white + Non-Hispanic youth. One possible explanation could be attributed to cohort effect: disproportionate amount of those in 15-19 group transitioned to 20-24 group during these years, but were not matched by the similar number of 10-14year old transitioning into 15-19 group. Another possible explanation could reside in migration patterns.\n\rQ2 - Suicide across lifespan\r\rQ2 - What ages are most vulnerable to suicide?\n\rTo explore whether certain age transitions are associated with increased suicidality, we plot the distribution of suicide events within each year of age among the observed years (2006 - 2018).\rThere appears to be two plateaux across the lifespan, each preceeded by sharp increase: the first from ages 25 to 40 and another from ages 45 to 60, after which the frequency of suicide declines monotonically.\nWe see a marked spike in deaths during the 17 to 18 transition.\rIt appears the majority of deaths in 10-14 groups could be attributed to 13 and 14 year olds (vertial dashed line). The plateau following the age 25 makes theoretical sense: after the turmoils of coming out of age and young adulthood, there life acquires a more stable character.\rAlso note, that when examining the trends within the 10-24 age group, the relationship between the age and the suicide mortality is very well summarized by a linear model (\\(R^2 = .85\\)):\r\rQ3 - Prevalent Methods\r\rQ3 - What are the most prevalent methods of youth suicide?\n\rFlorida Health Charts captures the causes of suicide mortality using 7 categories. We examine the raw event count and rates per 100,000 rates in the following two graphs:\nNotice that two methods gun and hanging consistently explain the most cases of suicide in this age group. Going further, we will collapse the other 5 categories into a single non-gun/hang, so that we have sufficient n to compute reliable rates.\n\rQ4 - Methods across Years\r\rQ4 - How do trends compare across the methds of suicide?\n\rWhen ignoring race and ethnicity, the average increase in the annual rate of suicide mortality from gun (+0.0996) is 1.5 times higher than that from Hanging (+.0672) and 2.6 times higher than other means (+.0377). Notice also, that mortality from firearms and hanging follow the trajectory closely described by a linear trend: \\(R^2\\) = .7 and \\(R^2\\) = .64, respectively.\n\rQ5 - Sex and Ethnicity\r\rQ5 - How do trends compare by race, sex, and means of means of suicide?\n\rThe most prominent increase, dwarfing others, is observed among White Non-Hispanic men, rising from 6.8 in 2006 to 11.3 in 2017, constituting a 65% growth. Between these years, the rate per 100,000 in this category was increasing on average by .33 per year.\nAmong white women of both Hispanic and Non-Hispanic origin, this growth was substantially smaller, about +.06 per year, similar to the growth in the rate of suicide by means other than firearms or hanging. However, suicides by hanging was increasing by +.09 per year.\nFor Non-White Non-Hispanic women, the largest growth in suicide rates was observed from hanging (+.1), while suicides by other means barely increased.\n\rsession information\rClick HERE to view report in its native environment of the suicide-prevention-2019 repository.\nFor the sake of documentation and reproducibility, the current report was rendered in the following environment.

My workshop was scheduled to open the workshop series, so I wanted to give the students some tools for visual exploration of longitudinal data. The target learning objectives aspired for participants to be able to:\nPlot time series of COVID-19 cases using ggplot2 package\rAdd interactive highlights to trajectories using plotly package\rCompute indicators for key epidemiological events in each country (e.g. day of the first death)\rConstruct country-specific timelines relative to key epidemiological events\rVisualize the sequence of key events for a group of countries\r\rNow you see why I used “aspired” instead of “intended”.

The dataset contains suicide mortality counts and population estimates for years 2006-2017, broken down by suicide means, county, sex, age group, and race. The .csv of this dataset is available for download. For details regarding data preparation, please consult the suicide-prevention-2019 repository.\n\rQ1 - What is the overall trajectory of suicides in FL between 2006 and 2017?\rSimilar to national trends, the rates of suicide in Florida has been on the rise since 2006. In 2006, the Department of Health registered 2,402 suicides, while in 2017 this number reached 3,141. On average, each year the total number of suicides in Florida increased by 57 during this time. While the rising number of suicides events could be partially explained by demographic growth (see full report for details ), when adjusted for population size the rate per 100,000 still indicated that suicides became more prevalent: the rate increased from 15 in 2006 to 17.2 per 100,000 in 2017, averaging .15 in annual growth.\r\rQ2 - How does change in suicide rates differ by AGE group?\rOnly two age groups, 35-44 and 45-54 exhibited decline in suicide rates, witnessed by a negative slope coefficient in the liniear model, regressing the rate on year. However, examination of the raw data point behind the linear model suggests that negative slope might be coincidental to an overal steady treajectory.\nFor all other age groups, the rates of suicides increased. The highest increase in suicide rates per 100,000 is observed in the 85+ group, for which the rate rose by .64 annualy from 21.3 suicides per 100,000 in 2006 to 25.3 in 2017.\n\rQ3 - How do suicide trends differ by SEX?\rAs expected, suicides are more more prevalent among men. Notably, the increase for men was steeper: from 2006 to 2017 the rate of suicides for men rose from 23.8 to 27.4 per 100,000, averaging .19 per year, wheras for women this increase was smaller, rising from 6.7 to 7.5, over the same time period, averaging .11 per year.\n\rQ4 - How do suicide trends differ by SEX and AGE group?\rThe top view helps comparing the overal level of suicide rates among age groups, accounting for sex differences. We see that the highest rates are among the oldest Floridians: 75-84 and 85+ groups, the latter exhibiting the fastest growth rate of 1.44 per year, rising by almost 20% from 49.2 per 100,000 in 2006 to 58.5 in 2017.\nTo better view the trends withing the age groups, we replot this figure with free y-axis, exposing more nuanced longitudinal trends.\n\rQ5 - How do suicide trends differ by RACE?\rWhite Non-Hispanics exhibit the highest suicide rate and also the steepest growth of .32 suicides per 100,000 per year. The top row of the graph places the trends on the same scale, while the bottom row displays them on individual scale. Note, however, that annual fluctuations are less meaningful for less populous ethnic groups, such as Black \u0026amp; Other + Hispanic\n\rQ6 - How do suicide trends differ by RACE and SEX?\rRegardless of the ethnic group, suicide is more prevalent among men, particularly of the White + Non-Hispanic origin. Notably, white non-hispanic women are more likely to commit suicide than women of any other ethnic group.\rReplotting with free y-axis helps us see that growth in suicide rate among men is not universal across ethnic groups. Suicide rate is actually decreasing among non-white men with Hispanic origin.\r\r","date":1587859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590278400,"objectID":"c0ce31a2103a48b522d48528a54aebf7","permalink":"/post/2020-04-26-florida-suicide-1/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-04-26-florida-suicide-1/","section":"post","summary":"Graphing the trends of suicides in Florida from 2006 to 2017, exploring the differences in age, gender, and race among persons 10 years and older","tags":["suicide","Florida"],"title":"Florida Suicides (1) - General Trends","type":"post"},{"authors":["Andriy Koval"],"categories":["reproducible research","analytic workflow","graph making"],"content":"\r\rAbstract\rThis blogposts shows how to extract population estimates data reported by the Florida Department of Health and prepare them for analysis, specifically, for exploring the trends in demographic growth between 2006 and 2020.\nClick HERE to view report in its native environment of the suicide-prevention-2019 repository.\n\rData Origin\rThe initial extract of the data was obtained from www.flhealthcharts.com, a reporting tool for population counts estimated by the Florida Department of Health.

To gain better understanding of their background, I have asked them to fill out a brief survey (see results in my slides)\nI had about 90 minutes, so I reasoned that instead of overwhelming them with technical information, which would leave little trace in their fatigued minds ( workshop was at the end of the day), I should create a resource that they would be able to use in the future. The time in workshop, then, should spent on gentle introduction to data analysis with R using the examples from this resource. This also gave my workshop the flexibility to accomodate learners of various skill levels: more advanced participants will have the material to study on their own if the talk leaves them underchallenged in any given point in time.\n\rLearning Objectives\rI wanted the audience to be exposed to examples of performing the following tasks:\nOrganizing data analysis in a RMarkdown document\n\rGraphing the predictions of a statistical model (logistic regression)\n\rJump-starting an analytic project using a project template\r\r\rDeliverables\r1. Organizing data analysis in a RMarkdown document\rI have created two reports, containing identidcal code that implemented basic exploration of Titanic data with logistic regression:\r- notebook-only - a notebook combining code and annotation in the same .Rmd file\r- separate-layers - a report separating the analytic layer (.R) from the annotation layer (.Rmd)\n\rpresentation slides\r\r\rGraphing a model\rCarefull not to overwhelm with details, I chose to focus on a basic logistic regression model predicting survival in the Titanic data.\n# Model 0\rsurvived ~ sex\r# Model 1\rsurvived ~ sex + age\r# Model 2\rsurvived ~ sex + age + passenger_class\r# Model 3\rsurvived ~ sex + age + passenger_class + port_embarked\r\rHowever, instead of focusing on interpreting the estimated parameters, I opted to generate predicted values and then to graph them to examine the effect respective variables would have on the binary outcome. We converted the log-odds into probabilities of the outcome (y-axis) and then mapped predictors on other visual dimension. To illustrate, the prediction for Model 2 survived ~ sex + age + passenger_class looked like this:\nmodel_2\n\r\rMaterials\r\rnotebook-only - analytic report as a notebook (combines code and annotation in the same .Rmd file)\rseparate-layers - analytic report separating the analytic layer (.R) from the annotation layer (.Rmd)\rpresentation slides\r\r\rAbstract\rThe workshop will review best practices of reproducible research including folder architecture, data preparation, graph making, statistical modeling, and script documentation. The workshop is targeted at researchers who are expected to conduct their own analysis of data and prepare reports that deliver the findings to both technical and executive audiences within health systems.

In August of the same year I joined the Integrative Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging (IALSA) network (NIH/NIA P01AG043362) at the University of Victoria (UVic), directed by Dr. Andrea Piccinin and Dr. Scott Hofer. With IALSA, I worked on developing reproducible analytics (R + GitHub) for remote collaboration, particularly for implementing coordinated statistical analyses among multiple longitudinal studies of aging via remote participation.\nInterest in data-driven narratives of human aging lead me to explore the use of electronic health records (EHR) for research and improvement of patient care. Since October 2015 I have been working with Dr. Kenneth Moselle, the director of the Applied Clinical Research Unit (ACRU) of Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) on curating the transformation of VIHA’s EHR into analyzable form and creating opportunities for academic and clinical researchers to work with these data in responsible and reproducible way. Together with Dr. Moselle I have launched a Data Science Studio at the University of Victoria, a research unit at the Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health dedicated to supporting its research affiliates and UVic students in accessing, handling, and modeling cross-continuum health records of VIHA.\nAt ACRU I worked on bridging healthcare data to analytic capacities of longitudinal modelling. My functions at ACRU included statistical and programming support for research and quality improvement projects, coordinating communication and empowering collaboration among three audiences: database managers, medical practitioners, and academic researchers. The overlap in my skills in statistical modeling, programming, and knowledge of VIHA’s electronic health records gave me a unique advantage to facilitate such a collaboration, the integrative nature of which offered great promises for improving patient care, medical science, and methodological practices of longitudinal research.\nIn August of 2017 I was awarded a CIHR Health System Impact Fellowship with BC Observatory for Population and Public Health of the BC Centre for Disease Control ($140,000 + $15,000 development fund). My program of work involved developing a system for population health surveillance that would focus on chronic diseases, with particular focus on mental health and substance use (MHSU) conditions, which tend to have high comorbidity rates, polysubstance use patterns, and slowly progressing pace of development. Drawing on my experience with EHR system employed by VIHA, I engaged various statistical modeling and learning techniques to construct analytic workflows capable of supporting clinical decisions at the point of service, while translating the acquired knowledge to be consumed by clinical stewards, system planners, and surveillance agencies.\nmindset\rData scientists describe the ultimate reality about data using various dialets of expression.

To protect against re-identification risks, the Ministry of Health required redacting small counts prior to releasing disease rates into public domain. These preparations, when conducted manually, have proven to be arduous, time consuming, and prone to human error.\n\rApproach\rWhile finding a “small” count (operationalized as “ \u0026lt; 5 ”) was straightforward, detecting conditions, in which suppressed values could be recalculated from related cells involved human judgement. As part of the embedded research by their Health System Impact Fellow (2017), the Observatory set out to automate this task, designing a reproducible workflow ( see section 5 of the poster ) that split data into disease-by-year data frames of a specific form ( 1 ), applied a sequence of logical tests ( 2 ) written to recognize conditions that made recalculation of suppressed values possible and printed a graph ( 6 ) for each case of suggested automatic redaction to be confirmed by a human ( 7 ).\n\rResults\rThe automated suppression was successfully integrated into the Dashboard maintenance. Data preparation, application of logical tests, and production of visual evidence were implemented in R and published as a version-controlled RStudio project on Github github.com/ihacru/suppress-for-release. A fully reproducible example with fictional data was made available to demonstrate the current logic of suppression and to ensure the availability of documentation for the future staff of the Observatory charged with Dashboard maintenance. To assist with learning, we designed a map of dependencies among the custom functions used for suppression ( 4 ) and illustrated their use in a simplified workflow ( 3 ), which allows studying the performance of logical tests before engaging the real data to applying the suppression logic ( 5 ) and to document the redaction decisions ( 7 ) Anticipating the evolution of suppression logic, we moduralized the logical tests ( 2 ) responsible for redaction and provided several options to vary the degree of preserved information ( blue vs light blue ).\n\rConclusions\rThis case of embedded research demonstrates the benefits and feasibility of integrating practices of reproducible analytics into routine workflow of epidemiological surveillance. We make a strong case for employing such learning devices as workflow maps ( 5 ) and function dependency trees ( 4 ) for structuring applied projects and ensuring their reproducibility.\n\r","date":1559088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559088000,"objectID":"68cee25142656a0448bc697f37c52ad4","permalink":"/publication/koval-2019-suppress-for-release/","publishdate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koval-2019-suppress-for-release/","section":"publication","summary":"Demonstrates the methods of suppressing small counts in a provincial surveillance system in preparation of data for public release.","tags":["small cell suppression","chronic disease surveillance","public health","reproducible research","ggplot2"],"title":"Suppressing Small Counts for Public Release","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emily C Duggan","Andrea M Piccinin","Sean Clouston","Andriy Koval","Annie Robitalle","Andrea R Zammit","Chenkai Wu","Cassandra L Brown","Lewina O Lee","Deborah Finkel","William H.

We visualize the variability in clinical histories of patients with confirmed diagnosis of (1) schizophrenia and (2) bipolar disorders.\n\rApproach\rThe linked data model includes three components. (1) The records of encounters with secondary and tertiary services provide a time-stamped tape of clinical events, in the context of which other clinical information can be interpreted. (2) Diagnostic profiles come from emergency and acute care administrative sources (National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) and Diagnosis Abstract Database (DAD), respectively). (3) Substance use and psychiatric profiles come from the Ministry of Health’s Minimum Reporting Requirements (MRR) for Mental Health and Substance Use (MHSU) conditions. We train statistical models to detect consistent patterns of service use (PSU) forming the basis for stratification mechanism.\n\rResults\rWe organize our data methods according to the guidelines of reproducible research, a technical enabler of a learning healthcare system. We present a series of information displays demonstrating clinical heterogeneity of diagnostically homogeneous cohorts by describing the variability in their clinical histories. We demonstrate how we operationalize PSUs related to (1) the rate of emergency department encounters (2) number of days spent in acute care and (3) the rate of engaging laboratory services. We employ these quantifications of severity and burden to compare and contrast clinical journeys of two diagnostically homogeneous groups: patients with schizophrenia and patients with bipolar disorder.\n\rConclusions\rWe can better understand the experiences of patients with chronic mental health conditions if we examine patients’ journeys through the healthcare system in the context of linked clinical history.

Two theoretically distinct methods of social influence that are represented within EMOSA models are social contagion, which is a type of direct one-to-one interpersonal social influence, and general diffusion, which is the kind of social influence that passes through media and other broad cultural channels. Past EMOSA models have been developed to explain adolescent problem behaviors such as smoking, drinking, precocious sexuality, and delinquency.\nIn the current paper, we adapt the EMOSA framework to model transitions in religious involvement during late adolescence. We fit the model to data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (the NLSY97), which is based on a national U.S. household probability sample spanning 10 years of longitudinal observation. The study applies EMOSA models to examine the relative influence on late adolescents of social contagion versus general diffusion.\nWe present several methodological innovations, including EMOSA applications in a new theoretical arena, a new Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for estimating EMOSA parameters, and graphical innovations to represent different parts of the EMOSA process. Results indicate moderate influence of social contagion contact on transitions in church attendance, but stronger general diffusion processes. Both methodological and substantive implications are discussed.\n\r","date":1318550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611100800,"objectID":"ef0eec99a8b7d1c9ffd4ce8cccb8dc9e","permalink":"/talk/2011-10-11-emosa-smep/","publishdate":"2011-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2011-10-11-emosa-smep/","section":"talk","summary":"Epidemic Models of the Onset of Social Activities (EMOSA Models) are applied to religious participation of emerging adults, evaluating whether such behaviour as attending church services a better explained by diffusive or contagious mechanisms of spread","tags":["religiosity","emerging adults","contagion","diffusion"],"title":"Epidemic Modeling of the Onset of Social Activities (EMOSA Models)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Andriy Koval"],"categories":["thesis"],"content":"\r\rdownload pdf\nDefended on August 8, 2008, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts, in the Quantitative Psychology program of Middle Tennessee State University.\nTable of Content\rI.
