My research practice is tightly intertwined with my teaching philosophy: I am a strong proponent of open science, reproducible research, and programming literacy among scientists. While at University of Victoria, [Dr. Andrea Piccinin][piccinin] and I received a teaching grant ($10,000) to develop an [Introduction to Statistical Modeling for Social Sciences][psy532] for graduate students that emphasized these skills and allowed students to develop practical, hands-on data science skills, while retaining the focus and rigor of an introductory statistical course.

In the summer of 2017, [Dr. Ken Moselle][github_acru] and I were invited by [Dr. Scott Hofer][hofer] to co-develop an experimental course on [Statistical Analysis of Administrative Health and Linked Longitudinal Encounter Data][psy513]  aimed at fostering the development of novel research tracks employing clinical transactional data of VIHA. Approaching teaching as training my future colleagues brought me generous dividends, both in terms of positive student evaluations, fulfilling professional relationships, and active partnerships for my current and future work. Looking forward, I would like to capitalize on my experience in organizing and managing multinational teams of researchers to develop learning environments that could bring people together via remote participation and make the most out of online learning.
