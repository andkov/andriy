The Health System Impact Fellowship (HSIF) program is founded on partnerships with health system and related organizations (e.g., public, not-for-profit, private for-profit organizations) that are committed to the program objectives, including providing enriching, stimulating and impact-oriented experiential learning opportunities for PhD trainees and/or post-doctoral fellows that accelerate their professional growth and career readiness and advance the organizationâ€™s impact goals regarding health system improvement.
