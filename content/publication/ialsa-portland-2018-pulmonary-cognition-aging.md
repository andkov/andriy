abstract = "Substantial research is dedicated to understanding the aging-related dynamics among individual differences in level, change, and variation across physical and cognitive abilities. Evaluating replicability and synthesizing these findings has been limited by differences in measurements and samples, and by study design and statistical analyses confounding between-person differences with within-person changes. In this second paper of a two-paper series, we conducted a coordinated analysis and summary meta-analysis of new results on the aging-related dynamics linking pulmonary function and cognitive performance. **Methods**: We used coordinated analysis to examine individual differences in level, rate of change, and occasion-specific variability in pulmonary and cognitive functioning using data from 16,753 participants across eight longitudinal studies. Results were then summarized using meta-analysis. **Results**: The coordinated analysis found consistent baseline associations in levels of pulmonary and cognitive functioning. Associations of rates of change and occasion-specific variability in pulmonary function and cognition were inconsistent across studies. Meta-analysis by cognitive domain showed small associations linking changes in pulmonary functioning with changes in processing speed and attention/working memory. Conclusions: Results provide limited evidence for a link between changes in pulmonary and cognitive function. Further, changes may occur among cohorts at different rates, supporting a domain-specific view of the aging process. Future work is needed to understand the co-occurrence and meaning of changes. Coordinated analysis provides a rigorous comparison approach for independent longitudinal studies."
