<h1>Reflections on US response</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Initial containment measures (shutting borders, locking down) were delayed and were not mandated nationally.<br />
</li>
<li>Testing got off to a slow start, never reached consistent sufficient capacity, and testing times remained too long, thereby impeding contact tracing.<br />
</li>
<li>Initial physical and human resources were insufficient for a pandemic response and there were challenges building them up<br />
</li>
<li>National leadership abdicated, and leadership fell to the states.<br />
</li>
<li>Some states may have reopened too early and quickly.<br />
</li>
<li>Noncompliance with mandates/guidelines may also have contributed to all three surges.<br />
</li>
<li>Lack of entitlements to care may have affected access to testing, treatment and outcomes.<br />
</li>
<li>The Trump Administration marginalised public health and scientific leaders, and contradicted and interfered with scientific guidelines and advice.<br />
</li>
<li>The healthcare workforce was not protected<br />
</li>
<li>Containment measures were politicised, and behaviour had a partisan basis.</li>
</ol>
