summary: Demonstrates how cross-continuum terrain of health services can be described in with flexible classification scheme.

abstract: Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA, aka Island Health) is one of 5 health authorities of British Columbia. VIHA administers about 1700+ individual programs (aka locations), spanning the full spectrum of health services. Starting in 2007, VIHA has been recording patientsâ€™ encounters with these programs using a single instance of Electronic Health Record system, CERNER-Millennium. Cross-continuum nature of CERNER-Millennium and moated nature of the geographical area of VIHA created a data source that captures almost complete patient trajectories through the space of health services. TTT cohort identifies users of Mental Health and Substance Use (MHSU) services of Island Health during the last ten years(2007 -2017).
